 # CryptoKnapsack

 ### Welcome to the CryptoKnapsack playground!

 Here, you can explore the [Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) - a famous optimization problem in computer science.
 
 Please make sure you open the playground's Assistant Editor so you can use the visual representation of the playground.

//: Let's first define the playground's `liveView` with a little inset so we have a nice border.
let margin: CGFloat = 15
let frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 500, height: 800)
let container = UIView(frame: frame)
container.backgroundColor = .white

let knapsack = KnapsackContainerView(frame: frame.insetBy(dx: margin, dy: margin))
container.addSubview(knapsack)

 That's it - now you can explore the **Knapsack Problem** in the Assistant Editor on the right.
 Once you have gotten a feeling for the problem, come back and check out some popular algorithms that solve it.
 
 In the end, you can write your own - and have the chance to win $1 million (see the playground description essay for details ðŸ¤“).

 ### Algorithm #1: The Greedy Algorithm
 
 First, we define an extension that will come handy once we write the algorithm.

 The **Greedy Algorithm** always makes the *locally optimal choice* at each point.
 
 Though it is very fast: `O(nlog(n))` (`n` being the number of items or coins) - it does not always give us an optimal solution.

 ### Algorithm #2: Dynamic Programming

 The **Dynamic Programming Algorithm** *does* give us an optimal solution, but it is only pseudo-polynomial.
 
 This means that its time complexity is `O(maxSize * n)` (`maxSize` being the capacity of the knapsack).
 
 You can check out my Swift implementation by Cmd-clicking the class name below.

 ### Algorithm #3: Your Own!
 
 Now it's time to write your own algorithm!
 Implement the `solve()` method, give it a name and add it to the knapsack - it will appear on the right.
 
 Have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ
